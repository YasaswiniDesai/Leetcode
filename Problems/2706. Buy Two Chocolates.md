https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates/

## Problem Description

```
You are given an integer array prices representing the prices of various chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer money, which represents your initial amount of money.
You must buy exactly two chocolates in such a way that you still have some non-negative leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.
```
```
Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [3,2,3], money = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot buy 2 chocolates without going in debt, so we return 3.
```

## Solution

The code sorts chocolate prices, considers the cheapest two, checks if affordable, and returns remaining money after buying then, it takes user input for 3 chocolate prices and total money, prints the remaining money after buying the cheapest two chocolates.

## Code

Java Code:

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    public static int buyChoco(int[] prices, int money) {
        Arrays.sort(prices);
        int two=prices[0]+prices[1];
        if(two>money){
            return money;
        }
        else{
            return money-two;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int prices[]=new int[50];
      for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
          prices[i]=sc.nextInt();
      }
      int money=sc.nextInt();
      int output=buyChoco(prices,money);
      System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```
