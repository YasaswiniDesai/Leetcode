## Problem Description

```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
```
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Solution

"For each number (i), check it with every other number that comes after it (j), and see if their sum equals the target." This way, you explore all possible pairs in the array.

## Code

Java Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{}; //no solution
    }
}

```
