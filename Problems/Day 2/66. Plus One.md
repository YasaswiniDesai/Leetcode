## Problem Description

```
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits,where each digits[i]
is the ith digit of the integer.

The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order.
The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
```
```
Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

Example 3:

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
```

## Solution
Here not to increase the Space we are replacing the array the same with just a changes at the end 
it have one more condition where array=[9] output need to be [1,0] so with help of 
carry we can separate this case and can use Arraycopy.

## Code

Java Code:
```java

import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int carry = 1;

        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int sum = digits[i] + carry;
            digits[i] = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;
        }

        if (carry > 0) {
            int[] result = new int[digits.length + 1];
            result[0] = carry;
            System.arraycopy(digits, 0, result, 1, digits.length);
            return result;
        } else {
            return digits;
        }
    }
}

```
