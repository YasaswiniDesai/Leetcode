## Problem Description

You are given three positive integers n, x, and y.

In a city, there exist houses numbered 1 to n connected by n streets. There is a street connecting the house numbered i with the house numbered i + 1 for all 1 <= i <= n - 1 . An additional street connects the house numbered x with the house numbered y.

For each k, such that 1 <= k <= n, you need to find the number of pairs of houses (house1, house2) such that the minimum number of streets that need to be traveled to reach house2 from house1 is k.

Return a 1-indexed array result of length n where result[k] represents the total number of pairs of houses such that the minimum streets required to reach one house from the other is k.

Example 1:

![bfs](https://github.com/YasaswiniDesai/Leetcode/assets/92711164/cbcbb0e7-72d4-443b-a57c-fc4958e18150)

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:

![bfs1](https://github.com/YasaswiniDesai/Leetcode/assets/92711164/41435419-587c-4dc3-ab6a-35ae19ff7a54)
```
Input: n = 5, x = 2, y = 4
Output: [10,8,2,0,0]
Explanation: For each distance k the pairs are:
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 4).
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 5), and (5, 3).
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 5), and (5, 1).
- For k == 4 and k == 5, there are no pairs.
```
## Solution

1.For each pair of houses (i, j) where i and j are different:
  * Calculate the distance between them using different approaches:
       * Direct distance between houses i and j.
       * Distance through a fixed point (x, y) in two different ways: first going through x and then y, and second going through y and then x.
2.For each calculated distance, update a result array:
   * Increase the count in the result array for the corresponding distance by 2 (because the distance from i to j is the same as from j to i).
3.Return the result array containing the counts of pairs for each distance.

## Code

Java Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public int[] countOfPairs(int n, int x, int y) {
        // Initialize an array to store the result (result):
        int[] result = new int[n];

        // Iterate over all pairs of houses:
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                // Calculate the minimum distance using a different approaches
                int val = Math.min(
                    Math.abs(i - j),  // Direct distance between houses i and j
                    Math.min(
                        Math.abs(i - x) + 1 + Math.abs(y - j),  // Distance through x and y
                        Math.abs(i - y) + 1 + Math.abs(x - j)  // Distance through y and x
                    )
                );
                // Update the result array based on the minimum distance 
                result[val - 1] += 2; // from i to j and j to i
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```
