https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-houses-at-a-certain-distance-ii/description/

## Problem Description

You are given three positive integers n, x, and y.

In a city, there exist houses numbered 1 to n connected by n streets. There is a street connecting the house numbered i with the house numbered i + 1 for all 1 <= i <= n - 1 . An additional street connects the house numbered x with the house numbered y.

For each k, such that 1 <= k <= n, you need to find the number of pairs of houses (house1, house2) such that the minimum number of streets that need to be traveled to reach house2 from house1 is k.

Return a 1-indexed array result of length n where result[k] represents the total number of pairs of houses such that the minimum streets required to reach one house from the other is k.

Example 1:

![bfs](https://github.com/YasaswiniDesai/Leetcode/assets/92711164/cbcbb0e7-72d4-443b-a57c-fc4958e18150)

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:

![bfs1](https://github.com/YasaswiniDesai/Leetcode/assets/92711164/41435419-587c-4dc3-ab6a-35ae19ff7a54)
```
Input: n = 5, x = 2, y = 4
Output: [10,8,2,0,0]
Explanation: For each distance k the pairs are:
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 4).
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 5), and (5, 3).
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 5), and (5, 1).
- For k == 4 and k == 5, there are no pairs.
```
## Solution

* Initialization:
  * Initialize an array called result to store the counts for each type of pair.
  * Determine the counts for pairs on the left, right, and in a circle.
* Calculations for Different Types of Pairs:
  * Calculate the counts for pairs within the circle (circleInternal).
  * Calculate the counts for pairs from a line to the circle on the left and right (lineToCircle).
  * Calculate the counts for pairs from one line to another (lineToLine).
  * Calculate the counts for pairs within a line (lineInternal).
*Return the Result
