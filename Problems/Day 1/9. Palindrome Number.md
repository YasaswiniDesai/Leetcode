## Problem Description

```
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome
,and false otherwise.
```
```
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Solution

Here we are Just simply reversing the given number and checking it weather the reverse number is equal to the given number.

## Code

Java Code:
```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int correct=x;
        int reverse=0;
        while(x>0){
            int rem=x%10;
            reverse=reverse*10+rem;
            x=x/10;
        }
        if(correct==reverse){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}

```
